# main objective to learn data association
* two methods for data association are-
1). embedding
2). object referencing

# difference between 1) & 2) is-: 
* embedding stores whole data inside the other object 
* for e.g. if a user has posts then whole body of posts will be stored inside 
* the user

* whereas in referencing user stores id of the posts that are associated with
* that user.

# Modular Exports (make the code modular)
* use module export to segment code and refactor code.
* module.exports= return_object

## remember that User and Post are objects in the file user.js & post.js
